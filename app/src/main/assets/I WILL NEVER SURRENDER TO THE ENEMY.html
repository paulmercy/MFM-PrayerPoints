<p><i>Make this Powerful confession: I am a soldier in the army of the Lord. The Lord Jesus Christ is my Commander-in-chief. I am a soldier, I am not a baby, I cannot be discouraged, I cannot quit. I will win, My God shall supply all my needs, I can do all things through Christ, Demons cannot defeat me, People cannot discourage me, Storms cannot wear me, Sickness cannot stop me, Persecution cannot silence me and hell cannot handle me, Death cannot destroy me, I will always triumph, I am a soldier marching to heaven, I have been taught by Holy Spirit and tested by fire.</i></p>
