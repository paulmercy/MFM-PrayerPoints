<b>Confession -</b> <b><u>Psalm 35:1-8:</u></b> <p><em>Plead my cause, O Lord, with them that strive with me: fight against them that fight against me. Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help. draw out also the spear, and stop  way against them that persecute me: say unto my soul, I am thy salvation. let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul: let the be turned back and brought to confusion that devise my hurt.  Let them be as chaff before the wind: and let the angel of the LORD chase them. Let their way be dark and slippery: and let the angel of the Lord persecute them. For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul. Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself: into that very destruction let him fall.</em></p>
