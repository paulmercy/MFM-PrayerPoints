<h4>Scripture Reading - Psalm 91</h4>
<b><i>Confession - Psalm 91</i></b>
<ol>
<li>I take authority over this year, in the name of Jesus. I decree that all the elements of this year will cooperate with me.
I decree that these elemental forces should refuse to cooperate with my enemies.
I speak unto the sun, the moon and the stars. They must not smite me. I pull down every negative energy planning to operate against my life this year.
This is the year  the Lord has made, I will rejoice and be glad in it. I dismantle any power uttering incantations to capture this year.
I render such incantations and satanic prayer null and void. I retrieve this year out of their hands, in the name of Jesus. Spirits of favour, counsel, might and power, come upon me, in the name of Jesus. I shall excel this year and nothing shall defile me. I shall posses the gates of my enemies.</li><br>
<li>The Lord shall anoint me with the oil of gladness above my fellows.
<li>The fire of the enemy shall not burn me. My ears shall hear good news and I shall not hear the voice of the enemy. My future is secured in Christ, in the name of Jesus. God has created me to do some definite services. He has committed into my hands some assignments which He has not committed to anybody. He has not created me for nothing. I shall do good. I shall do His work. I shall be an agent of peace. I will trust Him in whatever I do and wherever I am. I can never be thrown away or downgraded. There will be no poverty of body, soul and spirit in my life this year. The anointing of God upon my life gives me favour in the eyes of God and man all the days of my life. I shall not labour in vain.I shall walk this year in victory and liberty of the spirit.</li><br>
<li>This year the Lord will bless me and enlarge my coast, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>This year, I receive daily bread, good seed to sow every time, and money to spend always, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>My Father, let me be the advertisement of Your power this year, in Jesus’ name.</li><br>
<li>I cancel all appointments with sorrow, tragedy and evil tears this year, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>This year, I will encounter and experience full scale laughter in all fronts, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>As from now on, blood-thirsty demons and robbers will respect my appearance, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Whether I am on the sea, in the air or on the road, the evil forces there will bow to my authority, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything I have waited for till now, for a long time, shall be miraculously delivered to me this year, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Father, make me and my family members completely immune to any form of sickness or disease this year, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, I put myself and members of my family into the hands of the Lord, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, I will do what the Lord wants me to do, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; This year, I will make the decisions the Lord wants me to make, in Jesus’ name.</li><br>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Every enemy of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries,  scatter, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
