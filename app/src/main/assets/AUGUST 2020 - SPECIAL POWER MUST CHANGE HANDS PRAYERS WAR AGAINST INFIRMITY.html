<b><u>Three songs on the blood of Jesus.</u></b>
<p>
<ol>
<li> Father, we confess and repent of the sins that opened the door for this pestilence, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li> We plead for mercy and forgiveness, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li> O Lord, let Your mercy speak and have mercy upon us as a nation, in Jesus’ name.</li><br>
<li> O Lord, let Your healing power begin to operate upon our land, in Jesus’ name.</li><br>
<li> We bind and cast out the crowned dragon from the East out of our land, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li> Divine immunity, by the blood of Jesus, overshadow all our health workers, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li> Power of the Most High, overshadow those seeking for cure and prevention, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li> O Lord, grant our leaders divine wisdom to manage this crisis, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li> Every wicked spirit, assigned to terminate  my life, perish and to melt away like wax in the fire, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thunder fire of God, scatter, destroy, and break into pieces every dark gathering against my existence, in the nameof Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; The wall of the blood of Jesus is around me and my household, any evil force that comes near us shall catch fire, inthe name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Lord, let the power base of this pandemic in the heavenlies and the waters be broken to pieces, in the name of Jesus.16. O great wind from the wilderness, arise, locate the base of this pandemic and blow it away, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Blood of Jesus, laminate everyone in this country and protect them from death, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; As I dwell inside the envelope of divine fire, I become untouchable by the power of infirmity, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; O wind of God, arise and sweep away the scourge from our land, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the power in the blood of Jesus, we raise an altar of victory, praise, worship of Jehovah in the land and nations, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; We command the air to vomit all the seeds and tokens of death it has haboured, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Passover blood of Jesus, envelope our nation, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Passover blood of Jesus, envelope our land, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Passover blood of Jesus, envelope me and my family, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the power in the blood of Jesus, we stop the spread of this pandemic, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; By the thunder of Your power, O Lord, sweep away the power of this pandemic, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou pandemic, hear the word of the Lord, your time is up, die, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Every rage of eaters of flesh and drinkers of blood, we stop you before you stop us, in the name of Jesus.</li>
