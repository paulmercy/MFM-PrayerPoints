<b>Scripture Reading - Psalm 106, Col. 2:14-15</b>
<p><b>Confession:</b>
    <em>
        <p>By natural heritage, I was dead in trespasses, for I was brought forth in iniquity and conceived in sin in my mother’s womb; and according to the law, I was preserved for the wrath of God that was to be revealed upon the children of disobedience, but now I am God handiwork recreated in Christ Jesus, born a new that I may do these good works which God already predestined for me.</p>
        <p>Through the blood of Jesus Christ; I who was once far away, have been brought near to God. I am now engrafted in Christ my Messiah, I have become a new creature altogether. The previous moral and spiritual condition passed away; behold the fresh and new one has come.</p>
        <p>Therefore, since I am declared righteous and given a right standing with God through faith, I have peace with God through Jesus Christ. Now being justified by the blood of Christ, I shall be saved by Him from the wrath of God to come.</p>
        <p>The person who is united to the Lord becomes one spirit with Him. Therefore, there is now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the dictates of the flesh but after the dictates of the Spirit. For the law of our new being, which is the law of the dictates of the Spirit of life in Christ, has freed me from the law of sin and death.</p>
        <p>I am separated by God through the redeeming power in the blood of Christ my Messiah, the author and finisher of my faith, from every tie with ancestral covenants, curse, and guardian spirits.</p>
        <p>My citizenship is now of heaven. I belong to the house hold of God. My life is hidden with Christ in God. I am washed in the blood of him who loved me and gave his life for me. He has called me with a holy calling and by his name I am called.</p>
        <p>As it were, for it is He who delivered and saved me and called me with a calling in itself holy and leading to a life of consecration, a vocation of holiness. He did it not because of anything of merit that I have done, but because of and to further His own purpose, and grace which was given me in Christ Jesus.</p>
        <p>As it were, I am now cut off from evil consequences; I am physically and spiritually separated from their dos and don’ts. I no longer belong to any generation upon whom god could visit the sins of their fathers. Christ has redeemed me from such curses of the law. I cannot labor any longer under the weight of such yokes ad burden; I have received the yoke of Christ which is easy and His burden which is light.</p>
        Therefore, every interference of household wickedness and ancestral spirit disturbance in my life and ministry is a transgression against the covenant promises of God concerning me; for it is written; touch not my anointed and do my prophets no harm.
        <p>For it is written, as the God of heaven lives, let every manifestation and exhibition of rebellion from the ancestral and family sprits receive the undiluted anger of my god who is a consuming fire.<br>
            <p>For it written, it is a righteous thing for God to repay tribulation to those that trouble me, therefore, let every association of wicked spirits assembled against me be shattered by God. Let its hold in my life and my ministry be broken. Let its projections return back to it, let its plotting, scheming, maneuvering and operation receive divine frustration and let their wickedness come to an end in my life.</p>
        I reject every evil family and ancestral name; I renounce and reject their praise poems ever sung for me, I break the power of any evil dedication ever placed on my head, every pledge, vow, promise, or covenant ever made on my behalf with the blood of Christ.
        Henceforth Let no ancestral or evil family spirit have any hold on me and my ministry, Let them not have any entry point into my life, for now I bear in my body the marks of the blood of the lamb of god who has paid the price for my life and has bought me to belong to himself eternally.
