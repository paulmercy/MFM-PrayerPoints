<b><u>POWER UTTERANCES</u></b><br>
I am a child of God, I believe in the Father, I believe in the Son and I believe in he Holy Ghost. I believe that Jesus Christ came in the flesh and laid down his life, and shed His  Blood for me on the cross of Calvary. I believe that Jesus has defeated satan, and delivered me from this present evil world and satan. I have accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Saviour, I belong to the Lord Jesus Christ. I am a new creature, old things are passed away; my old life is done away with, I am now living a new life, the life I now live is in Christ Jesus. Jesus Christ has paid the price for me with His blood and set me free, satan and all his demons have no more power or dominion over my life, in Jesus’ name.</p> <p>All power in heaven and on earth is given unto me by Christ Jesus. In the authority of the name of Jesus Christ, I have the keys to the kingdom of heaven, whatsoever I lose on earth, is loosed in heaven. Right now, I lose myself from every imprisonment of the devil and his followers, in the name of Jesus. And whatsoever I bind on earth is bound in heaven. Right now I bind, and I put a stop to all the numerous activities of the devil made against me, in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>God has equipped me and made me a danger and a terror to all my enemies. The Lord has sent the fear and the dread of me upon all my enemies, that the report or information of me shall cause them to fear, tremble and be in anguish over me. I am a soldier for Christ, I am wearing the whole armour of God. The armour of God empowers me over the principalities, against powers, against rulers of darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness and against all the powers of darkness. I am God’s power house, the power of God resides on the inside of me, and is manifested on the outside of me. The glory of God is as a covering roundabout me, in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>In the name of Jesus Christ, all demons even satan are subject to me Through the name of Jesus, I push down all my enemies and they cannot hurt me. I send forth a mighty destruction to scatter, to destroy and break in pieces every gathering or associations of my enemies against me.  No plot, devices or counsel of the wicked against me shall stand and every tongue that shall rise up against me in judgement, I condemn it. Jesus Christ saves me from all those that rise up against me.</p>
<p>Jesus is my defender, Jesus is my rock, Jesus is my deliverer, Jesus is my strength, Jesus is my fortress and my high tower. No weapon that is formed against me shall prosper in Jesus. If the enemy comes against me, the spirit of the Lord will lift up a standard against them and they cannot pass through. The Lord Jesus Christ has set a bound round about me, there is a strong hedge of protection round about me, a powerful hedge that all the demons in hell including satan can never cross to reach me, in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>I believe and I receive the blood of Jesus Christ that was shed for me on the cross of Calvary, I am redeemed by the blood of Jesus. Right now, I take of the blood of Jesus Christ and I use it to set a boundary of the blood of Jesus round about me. I receive the blood of Jesus Christ upon me and upon my house where I live. When the enemy sees the blood, they shall pass over, the destroyers will not be able to enter in because of the blood of Jesus Christ. If my enemies seek me, they shall not be able to find me, for my life is hidden in the blood of Jesus. The blood of Jesus Christ is a covering and hiding place for me from all of my enemies including satan, in the name of Jesus.</p>
