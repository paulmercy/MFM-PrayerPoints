<b><em>As you confess these words of God concerning prosperity, you will receive victory over poverty, debt and financial lack.
Every wrong circumstance and every bad situation will be turned around.<br>
Every attack will be turned into victory. Be encouraged to confess it over and over again. Let the Word of God sink deep into your spirit.
No matter how you feel, no matter what you see, no matter what you have experienced in the past, God's Word always works. It never fails. Shout your prosperity confession right into the devil's face. Make this confession a part of your daily life and expect God to work a miracle for every need you have. Jesus is Lord of this earth. The earth with all its fullness belongs to God.<br>
As a joint heir with Jesus, I claim the wealth of this earth, for it belongs to Jesus.
I claim all that Jesus' death made available for me to receive. In Jesus' name, I command you devil to loose the wealth of this earth! Take your hands off now! I command every hindering force to stop! In Jesus' name, I bind you and render you ineffective against me! In Jesus' name, I command wealth to come to me now! Jesus is Lord of my life. Jesus is Lord of my finances. Jesus is Lord!</em></b>
