<h4>PRAISE WORSHIP </h4>
<h4>SCRIPTURE READING - 1 Chron. 4:9-10</h4>
<b><i>CONFESSIONS - Psalm 71:21 </i></b>
  <p>
<b><i>These are destiny changing prayers.There are ten reasons why you should pray them with holy madness.</i></b>
<ol>
<li>God has a plan for your life.</li><br>
<li>Right now you are either in that plan or out of it.</li><br>
<li>You are not an experiment or an accident.</li><br>
<li>God knew who you were before your mother and father ever brought you into the world.</li><br>
<li>If you do not take hold of your destiny, guard and protect it, you will loose it.</li><br>
<li>There is a conspiracy and battle going on to steal destinies.</li><br>
<li>There is a department in the dark world that destroys destinies.</li><br>
<li>When vision is lost, people do not pursue their destinies.</li><br>
<li>When there is no vision, there is no destiny.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; To every man or woman of destiny, there is a conspiracy in the heavenlies.</li><br>
</ol>
