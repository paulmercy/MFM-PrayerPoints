<b><u>PRAYER POINTS:</u></b>
<ol>
<li>I take authority over this year, in the name of Jesus. I decree that all the elements of this year will cooperate with me. I decree that these elemental forces should refuse to cooperate with my enemies. I speak unto the sun, the moon and the stars. They must not smite me. I pull down every negative energy planning to operate against my life this year. This is the year the Lord has made, I will rejoice and be glad in it. I dismantle any power uttering incantations to capture this year. I render such incantations and satanic prayer null and void.  I retrieve this year out of their hands, in the name of Jesus. Spirits of favor, counsel, might and power, come upon me, in Jesus name. I shall excel this year and nothing shall defile me. I shall posses the gates of my enemies.</li><br>
<li>The Lord shall anoint me with the oil of gladness above my fellows. The fire of the enemy shall not burn me. My ears shall hear good news and I shall not hear the voice of the enemy. My future is secured in Christ, in the name of Jesus. God has created me to do some definite services. He has committed into my hands some assignments that He has not committed to anybody. He has not created me for nothing. I shall do good.  I shall do His work. I shall be an agent of peace. I will trust Him in whatever I do and wherever I am. I can never be thrown away or downgraded. There will be no poverty of body, soul and spirit in my life this year. The anointing of God upon my life gives me favor in the eyes of God and man all the days of my life. I shall not labor in vain. I shall walk this day in victory and liberty of the spirit.</li><br>
