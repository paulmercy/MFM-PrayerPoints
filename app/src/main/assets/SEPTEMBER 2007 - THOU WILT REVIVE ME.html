<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh God, come as light, and illuminate the Scriptures unto me, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh God, let me see my sins as the nails that bind You to the cross, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh Lord, let me see my sins as the swords that pierce You by Your side, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Father, let me never slumber nor sleep the sleep of spiritual death, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh God, take me, sanctify me and use every faculty that I have, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Father, focus my mind on You and turn my trials to blessings, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>

<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; My Father, let every part of my character and conduct make a serious divine impression on others, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Every power assigned to injure the prosperity of my soul, die, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Every spirit of slumber, I bury you today, in Jesus’ name.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Every spiritual cataract, clear away from my vision, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Every witchcraft power drinking the blood of my spiritual life, die, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Strength of God, empower me, in Jesus’ name.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; I refuse to tarry in the valley of powerlessness, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Anything planted within me that has not manifested now but will manifest in future to make me backslide, dry up, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; O thou that troubleth the Israel of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, the God of Elijah shall trouble you today.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Every enemy of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, scatter, in Jesus’ name.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; O God arise and uproot anything You did not plant inside the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp; Let the fire of revival fall upon Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, in the name of Jesus.</li>
