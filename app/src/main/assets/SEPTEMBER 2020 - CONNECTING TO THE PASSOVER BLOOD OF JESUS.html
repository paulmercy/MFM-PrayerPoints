<li>Christ our Redeemer died on the cross, Died for the sinner, paid all his due; Sprinkle your soul with the blood of the Lamb, And I will pass, will pass over you.</li><br>
 <p><i>When I see the blood, When I see the blood, When I see the blood, I will pass, I will pass over you.</i></p>
<li>Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save; All He has promised, that He will do; Wash in the fountain opened for sin, And I will pass, will pass over you.</li><br>
<li>Judgement is coming, all will be there, Each one receiving, justly his due; Hide in the saving sin cleansing blood, And I will pass, will pass over you. </li><br>
<li>O great compassion! O boundless love! O loving kindness, faithful and true! O boundless love! under the blood, And I will pass, will pass over you.</li><br>
