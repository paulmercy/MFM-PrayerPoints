<b>POWER CONFESSION AND PRAYER FOR EXPECTANT FAMILY</b>
<p>
Father in the name of Jesus, I come to you today as your daughter, I am sorry for all my sins and the sins of my ancestors.
I forgive all those that have offended me, and I pray that those whom I have offended forgive me.
I close all doors opened for the enemy to afflict my life and family. By your mercy O Lord, forgive me, restore me and heal me of all physical and spiritual challenges in the Name of Jesus.
I believe and have faith in the unshakable words of God. The word of God is the power of God to deliver me from every conscious and unconscious bondage prospering in my life.
The word of God is God Himself speaking and not man. Therefore, nothing shall be impossible for me.
Father Lord, as I make this confession now, I pray you will watch over your word to perform it, because you are a faithful God.
You are not a man that you should lie, neither the son of man that you should repent. Rather you will not break your covenant, nor alter the word which has gone forth out of your mouth.
It is written that I shall decree a thing and it shall be established and the light of God shall shine upon me. The word of God is the light of men, it shines upon darkness and darkness comprehended it not. Father Lord, let your light of deliverance shine upon every dark area of my life, let your light through the blood of Jesus chase away dark presence hindering my supernatural conception.
I am a beloved child of the most highest God, called by the name of the Lord, redeemed, purchased and saved by the precious blood of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, shed for my deliverance on the cross of Calvary.
I believe in the ministry of my lord Jesus Christ, I believe in the healing power in blood of Jesus. Let the life giving blood of Jesus bring life into my womb, my home and my marriage.
I plead the precious blood of Jesus over my life and family and over every situation that has challenged my life.</p>
