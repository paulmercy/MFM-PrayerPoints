<h4>Praise Worship</h4>
<p><b><u>Confess this modified version of Psalm 23:</u></b> The Lord is my banker ; I shall not owe. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He restoreth my loss: He leadeth me beside still waters. Yea though I walk in the valley of the shadow of debt, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me; thy silver and thy gold, they rescue me. Thou preparest a way for me in the presence of business competitors; Thou anointed my head with oil, my cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life and I shall do business in the name of the Lord. Amen.</p>
