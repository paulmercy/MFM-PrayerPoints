Prayers of foundational ministerial deliverance AND INHERITED LIMITATIONS have to be done aggressively and violently. No stone should be left unturned. You must hate the foundational bondage with perfect hatred.<br>
<h4><i>CONFESSIONS: Galatians 3: 13-14</i></h4>
<p>Christ hath redeemed us from the curse of the law, being made a curse for us: for it is written, Cursed is every one that hangeth on a tree: [14] That the blessing of Abraham might come on the Galatiles through Jesus Christ; that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.
<b>2 Tim. 4:18</b> And the Lord shall deliver me from every evil work, and will preserve me unto his heavenly kingdom: to whom be glory for ever and ever. Amen.
<b>Col. 1:13</b> Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:
<b>Col. 2:15</b> And having spoiled principalities and powers, he made a shew of them openly, triumphing over them in it.</p>
