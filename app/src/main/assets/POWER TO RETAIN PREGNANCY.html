Jesus is Lord over my spirit, soul and body for the word of God tells me that at the name of Jesus every knee shall bow. I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. Jesus has delivered me from the powers of darkness and has translated me into the kingdom of His Dear Son. In Jesus I have redemption through His shed blood and also forgiveness of sins. Jesus has blotted out the handwriting of ordinances that was against me which was contrary to me, and took it out of the way nailing it to His cross. I am the body of Christ. I am redeemed from the curse because Jesus bore my physical and spiritual diseases in His body.  I have the mind of Christ and hold the thoughts, feelings and purposes of His heart.</li><br>
