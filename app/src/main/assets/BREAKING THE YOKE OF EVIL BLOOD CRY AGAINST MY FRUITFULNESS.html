<b><i>Confession: Psalm 46: 1-11</i></b>
<h4>Text: Psalm 56:1-13, 127: 3, Hosea 9:11, Matthew 9: 20-22, Luke 11:9, Mark 11:12.</h4>
<p><em>My beloved, I want you to relax your mind, for you will have children of your own because you are still alive. When we talk about yokes, it is not what you can see with your naked eyes. There are physical and there are spiritual yokes. It is a very hard battle. This yoke is like when evil load is being placed on a person’s head.</li><br>
Yokes can be words spoken through anger, spells, curses, that have been issued against someone that has the potency to tie down their lives. This yoke can be from the mind and it can cause pain, sorrow and daily tears. It can happen to kings, presidents, even pastors, etc.
As strong as a donkey is, when a load like a whole house is put upon it and chains put around its legs, it will never be able to move; that load can even kill it, unless it is set free by lifting the load from off it. If the physical yoke is this hard, what can one say about the spiritual ones which earthly doctors cannot diagnose? It takes only divine intervention for one to be free.
This makes me to remember a lady that put herself in a yoke. The first day she came to me, she asked me to pray for someone to die. I told her God did not call me to kill people. She now said, I should give her prayer point to pray for the person to die. But I told her we are not wrestling against flesh and blood. Curiously, I asked about the person she so desired to kill. She said, she got married fifteen years ago without any child. However, a woman has got three children already for her husband. It was that woman she wanted to kill. I told her to forgive the woman and her husband. She asked me if she could say something she had kept hidden inside her for a very long time. I told her to go ahead. She told me she was the only child of her parents and her father was dead. She said during her secondary school days in their village, she had a boyfriend that deflowered her and got her pregnant. When her mother got to know about it, she encouraged her to keep the pregnancy because she wanted to see her grandchild. She hearkened to her. When the time came for her to deliver, it was at midnight. Her mother tried to help her, but when she could not, she ran out to call for help. However, before they came back she had delivered a baby boy and the placenta also had come out by itself. But because she saw the baby as something that would hinder the progress and continuation of her studies, she suffocated him to death by blocking his mouth and nostrils. She watched the baby as he struggled to death. When her mother entered, she cried that the enemy had killed her grandson. She did not tell her what she did.
You might have been in a similar situation where you had to abort because of your career and future goals. Perhaps, you have helped or advised people to abort in the past, this could have incurred Gods anger upon you and your household; nevertheless, ask God for forgiveness so that He can come to your rescue.</em></p>
