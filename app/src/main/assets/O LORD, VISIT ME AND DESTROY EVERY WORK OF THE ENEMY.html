<b>Bible reading: Exodus 2:1-9, Judges 13:2-25, Psalms 83:1-18, 1st Samuel 1:1-28, Psalm 128:1-6</b>
<h4><i>Confession: Psalms 20:1-9, Psalms 1:1-3, Matthew 17:14-20, Genesis 21:1-3</i></h4>
When God visits a nation, a family or an individual, it could either result in good or bad for the enemy. It could result in a disaster, while peace, joy and happiness are for the children of God. The Lord visited the land of Egypt because of the children of Israel. He did mighty unforgettable wonders. When a person call on God day and night without giving Him a breathing space and is expectant, the visitation of God might be earlier than expected or He could decide not to come as early as they think. But one thing is certain, He will surely come. When God comes, one’s spiritual life and physical life will change. He wipes clean all filthiness for Him to answer by fire.
When the Lord visits you, your life will experience a turnaround breakthrough, good things will spring forth, everlasting joy will be your lot; you will laugh last and experience deliverance from all bondages. Your fears will be handicapped and the enemies will fear you. You will have victory over your enemies, bad dreams will come to an end, sicknesses will disappear; bitterness, long-time sorrow, misfortunes, bad luck, marital challenges and affliction of all forms shall disappear.
I decree into your life that the God that created Dr.Daniel Olukoya, who gave him the vision of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, sustaining the vision from dying and established this ministry will establish good things in your life in the name of Jesus.
You are the next to testify, congratulations.
