<b>STEPS TO PERSONAL DELIVERANCE</b>
<p><ul>
    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step ONE – Start with praise worship, praise God with worship songs</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step TWO – Confess out loud Scriptures promising deliverance. A few of them are: Luke 10:19, Ephesians 1:7, Romans 16:20, Revelation 12:11, Colossians 2:14, 15, Galatians 3:13, 14, Psalm 91:3 and 2 Tim. 4:18.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step THREE – Break covenants and curses to destroy their legal hold. You can pray a simple prayer: “I break any curse against me,” or “I break any covenant against me.” A simple prayer with much result.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step FOUR – Bind all the spirits associated with those covenants and curses, like this: “I bind all the spirits attached or connected to the curses and covenants, I have just broken, in the name of Jesus.”</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step FIVE – Lay one hand on your head and the other on your stomach or navel and begin to pray like this: “Holy Ghost fire, burn from the top of my head to the soles of my feet.” Mention every organ of your body; your kidney, liver, intestines, blood, etc. You must not rush. The fire will actually come and you may start feeling the heat.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step SIX – You begin to saturate yourself with blood of Jesus. You say: Blood of Jesus, enter into my spirit, soul and body.” Next, you say: “I drink the blood of Jesus.”</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step SEVEN – It is now that you are able to demand firmly, in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, that any spirit that is not of God, should leave you. You demand it forcefully like this: “In the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, I come against all you hidden spirits and I bind your activates in my life. You can no longer hide below the surface because I now recognize what you have been doing; release me in the name of Jesus.” If sickness is the problem, address it and say: “You spirit of infirmity, I speak to you directly, get out of my life now. I am redeemed by the blood of Jesus Christ, come out and go now. Go out with every breath by the power of the Holy Spirit. I prevail over you.”</li>
<p>At this point, you stop talking; open your mouth and nose and take three to seven deep breaths and expel them forcefully through your mouth and nose. You may be surprised that strange things would begin to happen. Repeat this stage again and again; issue the command, and repeat the breathing in and out.</p>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Step EIGHT – When you have finished the expulsion stage, you ask for a fresh in-filling of the Holy Spirit, and close the session with praises.
<p>Anytime you are attacked in your dream, rise and go through the steps, mentioned. It keeps you from becoming sick; it removes every evil seed of the enemy and charges your body with fire. It uproots evil plantations and builds up your confidence.
Every night, before you go to bed, remember these three important prayer points. Pray for the walls of fire to surround you. The Bible says: “For I, saith the Lord, will be unto her a wall of fire round about, and will be the glory in the midst of her.”
Two, pray for the blood of Jesus to be upon you. Three, pray that the angels of God should surround you. No matter how sleepy you are, make sure you pray these three prayer points nightly.</p>
