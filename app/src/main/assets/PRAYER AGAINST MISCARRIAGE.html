<b><u>What Is Miscarriage?</u></b>
<p><b>Miscarriage</b> is defined as the spontaneous loss of a foetus before it is viable.<br> In the USA, it is the 20th week of pregnancy and in the UK, the 23rd week. The medical term for miscarriage is <i>“spontaneous abortion”</i>.
A foetus is “viable” when it has the potential to survive outside the womb.
Miscarriage is one of the most common complications associated with early pregnancy. Sadly, around a quarter – or even more – of all pregnancies result in miscarriage.
Most miscarriages occur during the first few months of pregnancy. An estimated 75% of miscarriages happen during the woman’s first trimester.
Although miscarriage is relatively common, it can be an extremely traumatic and devastating experience.
<p><b><u>What are the Signs and Symptoms of Miscarriage?</u></b></p>
The main sign of miscarriage is vaginal spotting or bleeding, which can vary from slight brownish discharge to very heavy bleeding.
Other symptoms include:
</p>
<p>
<ul>
       <li>&nbsp;-Cramping and pain in the abdomen</li>
        <li>&nbsp;-Fluid discharge from the vagina</li>
       <li>&nbsp;-Tissue discharge from the vagina</li>
        <li>&nbsp;-Feeling faint or light-headed</li>
</ul>

If you are pregnant and experience any of the symptoms mentioned here, contact your doctor, midwife, ante-natal clinic for help and your pastor for spiritual counselling immediately.

<p><b><u>Causes of Miscarriage</u></b></p>
<ol>
<li>Placental problems: If abnormal development of the placenta occurs, then the blood supply from the mother to the baby is limited.</li><br>
    <li>Chromosome problems: Sometimes a foetus can receive either too many or not enough chromosomes at conception. This causes abnormal development of the foetus. Miscarriages that occur during the first trimester are mainly related to chromosomal abnormalities in the baby.</li><br>
        <li>Womb structure abnormalities: Abnormally shaped wombs and the development of fibroids in the womb can put a developing foetus at severe risk.</li><br>
            <li>Polycystic ovary syndrome: This occurs when the ovaries are too big, causing hormonal imbalances in the womb.</li><br>
                <li>Weakened cervix: The cervix is the neck of the womb. When the muscles of the cervix are too weak, they can open up too early during pregnancy, resulting in miscarriage.</li><br>
                    <li>Lifestyle factors: Habits such as smoking, drinking alcohol, or using illegal drugs can lead to miscarriage.</li><br>
                        <li>Sex in the Dream: If you experience having sex with a known or unknown person, the unpleasant experience can lead to miscarriage.</li><br>
                            <li>Seeing blood or any red object in the dream:This could be blood, red pepper and things associated with sex. They are all indications that there is danger ahead.</li><br>
                                <li>Breast feeding in the dream: Breastfeeding a baby is a strong indication that there is an impending problem.</li><br>
                                    <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Seeing menstrual materials in the dream: Menstrual pad being used or bought in the dream are pointers to a problem</li><br>
                                        <li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Being attacked by any kind of animal in the dream: Being hit or attacked by animals in the dream could cause miscarriage too
</ol>
