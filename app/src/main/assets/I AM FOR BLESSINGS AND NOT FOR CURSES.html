<b>Praise Worship</b>
<h4><i>Confessions</i></h4>
<p>
Jesus Christ has purchased my freedom from the curses of the law and all its condemnation, by offering Himself as a curse for me. I can no longer labour under the burden of the law for I have become a saint, a lively stone, a built-up spiritual stone and a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God by Christ. I am a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a peculiar person, that I should show forth the praises of Him who has called me out of darkness into His marvellous light.<br>
The Name of Jesus Christ is given unto me to exercise authority in three different worlds, the earth, the seas and beneath the earth. For the Bible says, “God has highly exalted him has freely bestowed upon him the name that is above every name, so that when I pronounce that name it becomes a strong tower for me, it makes everything in the heavenlies that is against my prayers to bow, so also those in the earth and in the seas beneath the earth.<br>
In Jesus’ name I take authority over the heavenlies, the earth, the seas and under the earth and the things in them. I destroy, with the sword of the Spirit, everybody of darkness that is poised to stand against my prayer or to reinforce against me.<br>
Jesus Christ is my personal Lord. He is my Saviour. He is my redeemer and my deliverer. His blood has done so much for me and it is the reason for my living today. The blood saves me from the wrath of God inspired by the consequences of my sins. Through the blood I have received forgiveness of my sins; through the blood God became merciful to my unrighteousness and He is no longer remembering my past. Now, I am justified by the blood of Jesus Christ, for faith in the blood of Jesus delivers me from every accusation that the devil makes against me.<br>
It is written that if Jesus Christ sets me free, I am free indeed. I confess and receive freedom from every ancestral curse of untimely death, ancestral curse of marital destruction or frustration, ancestral curses of poverty or financial handicaps, ancestral curse of infirmities, and ancestral curses of failure at the edge of breakthroughs.<br>
By the blood of Jesus, there is no condemnation for me who is in Christ Jesus, for I walk not after the flesh, but after the spirit and the law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus has made me free from the law of sin and death. I confess that every ancestral dedication of children in my family lineage to idols, god’s sacred waters and trees is broken upon my life. For I shall not suffer for the sins of my forefathers, everyone shall bear his own iniquity. By the blood of Jesus every unconscious covenant with familiar spirits in my family, be broken and release me.<br>
By the power in the blood of Jesus I decree that every curse of sexual immorality over my life, as a result of incest, lesbianism, homosexuality, bestiality, fornication, adultery, oral sex, abortion, sexual sins of my father, sexual iniquities of my mother, be broken now, in the name Jesus. For Jesus was bruised for my transgressions.<br>
Every curse affecting my dwelling place, positions, land and properties, as a result of any past rituals or sacrifices performed on them, be broken by the power in the blood of Jesus.<br>
It is written, life and death are in the power of the tongue and by the words of our mouth we shall be condemned or justified. Every curse placed over my life and property through witchcraft curses, spells, jinx, enchantments and incantations, be broken by the blood of Jesus. Every curse I have personally attracted to my life through my actions, promises, vows oaths and negative confessions, be broken by the blood of Jesus. The scripture says, whatsoever I bind here on earth shall be bound in heavens. I bind the activities of these curses and loose myself from their grip.
