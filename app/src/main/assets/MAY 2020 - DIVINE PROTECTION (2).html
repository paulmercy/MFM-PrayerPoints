<b><u>POWER UTTERANCES</u></b><br>
I am a child of God. I believe in the Father. I believe in the Son and I believe in the Holy Ghost. I believe that Jesus Christ came in the flesh and laid down His life, and shed His Blood for me on the cross at Calvary. I believe that Jesus has defeated satan, and delivered me from this present evil world and satan. I have accepted Jesus Christ as my personal Lord and Saviour. I belong to the Lord Jesus Christ. I am a new creature, old things are passed away; my old life is done away with, I am now living a new life, the life I now live is in Christ Jesus. Jesus Christ has paid the price for me with His blood and set me free, satan and all his demons have no more power or dominion over my life, in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>According to the word of the Lord, if I eat or drink  any deadly or harmful thing, it shall not hurt me. I curse every sickness and disease that have attacked or intend to attack my body and I command them to die and disappear from my body right now, in the name of Jesus. 
As a child of God, the Spirit of God is a guide for me. I am led by the Spirit, for those who are led by the Spirit of God are the sons of God. Because I acknowledge God as my father, He will order my footsteps and will direct my path, in the name of Jesus. I am not lazy and I will not slack to follow the leading of the Spirit of God in my life. I am energetic at all times, always yielding and ready to be in total obedience to God, in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>I reject, I refuse and I bind every voice of the devil in my life today and always, in the name of Jesus.  The voice of the stranger I will not hear; the leading of the stranger I will not follow. The Lord is my shepherd and it is Him I will hear and it is Him I will follow forever, for Jesus is my Anchor, in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>I cancel all negative confessions that I have made at anytime in my life. I agree with the will of God for my life. I come against all negative confessions spoken by me or anyone against me. As I speak, I send the power in the word of God to change every negative confession to positive, in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>By the power in the blood of Jesus, every evil word spoken against my health shall not stand, for I am healed by the stripes of Jesus, in the name of Jesus. Evil words against my finances shall not stand. I am rich, and I shall not lack any good thing in life, in the name of Jesus. Evil words against my marriage shall fail. My marriage shall be stable. I will have peace in my marriage, in the name of Jesus. Satanic words against my children shall backfire. My children shall prosper in every area and they shall have peace, in the name of Jesus. Evil wish against my career/business shall not come to pass. What God has purposed for my life shall be accomplished, in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>Evil words against my safety shall fail. For it is written ten thousand shall fall at my side, but it shall not come near me and I will not fear for anything, in the name of Jesus.  Satanic words against my life shall die by the power in the blood of Jesus. My God shall satisfy me with long life and prosperity, in the name of Jesus.</p>
<p>By the power in the blood of Jesus, I erase all negative words spoken, all evil statements, all doubtful statements, all enchantments and all other statements that do not glorify God but the devil. I wipe them all away by the power in the blood of Jesus, in the name of Jesus.</p>
