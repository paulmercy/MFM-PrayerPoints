<h4>Scripture Reading - Psalm 27</h4>
<b><i>Confessions - Psalm 125:3</i></b>
<p>
Make these confessions violently. The word of God concerning my life is settled in heaven. I bind myself to the eternal word of God. I decree that any dream, word, vision, that did not originate from God are cancelled in my life. Every tree my heavenly Father has not planted, I uproot them, in the name of Jesus. I fire back, every spiritual bullet fired against me in my dreams. I surround myself with the fire of God. No power of darkness will have a way into my life again. My Father, let Your heavenly hosts and Your warriors, take over my battles. Oh Lord of hosts, arise and fight for me. I arise and put on the whole armour of God and I resist every power of darkness. Every power assigned to manipulate my life, I crush you, in the name of Jesus. Every evil spirit that has attacked me in my dream, I command you to be disgraced, in the name of Jesus. By the power in the blood of Jesus, be bound and overthrown.
