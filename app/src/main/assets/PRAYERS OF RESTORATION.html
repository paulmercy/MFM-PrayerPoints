<b>Zec. 10:6</b>
    <p><ul>
    <li>&nbsp;When your debtors are refusing or are unable to pay.</li>
    <li>&nbsp;When you lose your job unrighteously</li>
    <li>&nbsp;When your things have been stolen and you desire recovery and arrest of the thieves</li>
    <li>&nbsp;When you desire a recovery of past financial losses</li>
    <li>&nbsp;Whenever you want to 'possess your possession' No matter the spiritual height from which you have fallen, God is very much interested in restoring you, if only you can cry unto Him for mercy.</li>
</ul>
</p>
    <b>Job 42:10</b>: <i>"And the Lord turned the captivity of Job, when he prayed for his friends; also the Lord gave Job twice as much as he had before."</i> (It is the devil's job to steal, to kill and to destroy.
    <b>John 10:10)</b>. His greatest design is to destroy the image of God in man. He will use any method.<br>
<p>The Bible says, <i><b>"When the hedge is broken, the serpents will bite" (Ecclesiastes 10:8)</b>.</i> Many, through carelessness break the protective hedge God has placed around their lives and property. Thus they allow the enemy to destroy it. The good news is that what is killed, stolen or destroyed by the enemy can be restored by God. Jesus said, <b><i>"I am come that you might have life and life more abundantly"</i></b>(John 10:10). God has promised in <b><u>Joel 2:25</u></b>  to restore unto us our lost and wasted years. Everything lost to the devil will be restored by God. Job lost all but in the end everything was restored to him even in multiple-fold. As you pray these prayer points, power for restoration will be released into your life.</p>
<b>Confession - Jeremiah 1:12</b> <i>"Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten my word to perform it."</i><br><br>
<b>Joel 2:25-26</b> <i>"And I will restore to you the years that the locust hath eaten, the cankerworm, and the caterpillar, and the palmerworm, my great army which I sent among you. And ye shall eat in plenty, and be satisfied, and praise the name of the LORD your God, that hath dealt wondrously with you: and my people shall never be ashamed.</i><br><br>
<b>Isaiah 41:18-20</b> <b><i>"I will open rivers in high places, and fountains in the midst of the valleys: I will make the wilderness a pool of water, and the dry land springs of water. I will plant in the wilderness the cedar, the shittah tree, and the myrtle, and the oil tree; I will set in the desert the fir tree, and the pine, and the box tree together: That they may see, and know, and consider, and understand together, that the hand of the LORD hath done this, and the Holy One of Israel hath created it.</i></b>
