<h4>Scripture Reading - Acts 16:25-40</h4>
<b><i>Confessions - Isaiah 40:28-31</i></b><br>
Make these confessions loud and clear:  I am an eagle of God. My wings shall not be clipped by any evil power, I refuse to be caged by frustration, disappointments, destructive habits, worldliness, carelessness, prayerlessness and dark powers, in the name of Jesus. Whether the enemy likes it or not, the eagle of my destiny shall fly. I overthrow every establishment delegated to cage my destiny. The Spirit of the living God shall come upon me and I shall become a new person.<br>
