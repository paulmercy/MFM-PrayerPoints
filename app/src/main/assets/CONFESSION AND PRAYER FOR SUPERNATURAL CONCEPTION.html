<b><i>CONFESSIONS: Deuteronomy 7: 13-15; Exodus 23: 25-26; Ps91:10, Ps 127:3-5; 128:3; Mal 3: 10 -11</i></b>

<p>“Father, we, thank you that children are the heritage of the Lord, and the fruit of the womb is His reward. Children are Your idea Father, you thought up children and family and home.
You instituted the family in the Garden of Eden. You ordered children, You commanded tem when You said to Adam and Eve,
“Be fruitful and multiply” You said that the barren womb us never satisfied, Lord, the Word declares that I am wonderful and fearfully made by You; therefore I am perfect and able to conceive and have children.
You said that I(my wife) would be a fruitful vine by the side of our house and our children like olive plants around our table. We are not ashamed but happy because our quiver is full of children (or arrows, as You call them)
<br>“Thank you, Father, that you designed and fashioned me/her, to have children that in the Bible barrenness was the exception, not the rule, not your will, not normal, something against your plan and purpose.”
And in Your goodness and faithfulness, every barren woman in the Bible who was godly and believed Your Word became pregnant. You opened her womb and bless her, and she gave birth to a precious baby just as I/she will.
You make the barren woman to keep house and to be a joyful mother of children.<br>
You said, Father that because You are our God and we are your people and have a covenant with You, the You will love us and bless us and multiply us and bless the fruit of my/her womb and that neither male or female among Your people would be barren.
Father, we are redeemed from the cause of the Law by Jesus and being barren is under the curse of Law; therefore; we will receive from your grace and have children.
“Father, no plague, no evil shall come nigh our dwelling. We are healed by the stripes of Jesus. Sickness of any kind is taken out of our midst.
You said ask anything of You in Jesus name and it would be done, and that if two of us on earth agree as touching anything it would be done. So we pray and agree With You and Your word Father, that we will conceive and bring forth a healthy, precious baby to Your glory and honour. We pray all this according to Your Word and will. You said this is the confidence that we have in you, that if we ask anything according to Your will, You hear us, and if You hear us, we know we have the petition we desire of you. We have it now. Thank you father, in Jesus Name.</p>
