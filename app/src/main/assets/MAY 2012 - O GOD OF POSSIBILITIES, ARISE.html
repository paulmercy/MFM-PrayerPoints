<li>Before I finished praying these prayers, oh Lord, let Your angels move into action on my behalf, in Jesus’ name.</li><br>
<li>Every prince of persia and all territorial spirits around me, that are hindering the manifestation of God’s miracle in my life, scatter, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>I bind and cast out of my vicinity, all prayer and miracle blockers, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>You miracle hijackers, release my miracles now by fire, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>Every satanic umbrella preventing the heavenly showers of blessings from falling on me, catch fire, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>Oh God, arise and let my heavens open right now, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>Every obstacle in my life, give way to miracles, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>Every frustration in my life, become a bridge to my miracles, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>I decree by fire and thunder that I shall not die before the manifestation of my miracles, in Jesus’ name.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;You miracle hijackers, release my miracles now by fire, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;My Father, arise by Your signs and wonders and visit my life, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the rising of the sun, O God of wonders, arise in my life, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the wonder-working power of God be released on my situation for signs and wonders, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let signs and wonders appear in my life, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Holy Ghost fire, visit me with Your signs and wonders, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh God, arise and hear me in the day of trouble, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not die because of my problems, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not be disgraced because of my problems, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the fire of God begin to attack all miracle hijackers assigned against my life, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;God has made me a product of His possibility, no good thing shall be impossible for me, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every curse and covenant of impossibility over my life, break, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou Goliath of impossibility in my life, die, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not die undiscovered, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not die unused and unsung, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not die uncelebrated and unmissed, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I shall not die unfruitful and unfulfilled, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every good thing the enemy has swallowed in my life, be vomited, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh God arise and send me help from the sanctuary and strengthen me out of Zion, in Jesus’ name.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;O Lord, let my soul be prevented from death, my eyes from tears and my feet from falling, in Jesus’ name.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;People will hear my testimonies and glorify the name of God in my life, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I use the blood of Jesus to fight and defeat every spirit of impossibility in my life, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I release myself from the collective captivity of impossibility, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every seed, root and tentacles of impossibility in my life, die, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I withdraw my name and all about my life from the altar of impossibility, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;I refuse to swim in the oceans of impossibility, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every King Uzziah that is making it impossible for me to see the glory of God, die, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;O thou that troubleth the Israel of Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, the God of Elijah shall trouble you today.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Every enemy of the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries,  scatter, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;O God,  arise and uproot anything You did not plant inside the Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, in the name of Jesus.</li><br>
<li>&nbsp;&nbsp;Let the fire of revival fall upon Mountain of Fire and Miracles Ministries, in the name of Jesus.</li>
