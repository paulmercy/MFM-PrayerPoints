<b>Bible Reading: Ps 46: – 11, 54:1 – 7, Isa 61:1-4, Deut.28:1-14</b>
<p><i>Beloved, the room of darkness is not a room that can be seen with the ordinary eyes unless God opens your eyes or you pray to a certain level and God gives you revelations about it. What we are talking about is a spiritual room that exists in the spirit. These evil spiritual rooms differ from one another and the enemies choose which room they want to lock their victims in. These rooms could be inside the rock, tree, and animal, in the air, ground or grave yard. This reminds me of the testimony of a man who at the age of 56years was neither married nor have children. This man has never had any sexual urge since he was born (impotent) but he said he was always having a dream of seeing himself, a woman and 3 children in a room. This continued until the day someone told him to his face that his life was meaningless.  This made him go into 14 days fasting and prayer program. On the 14th day of the program he had a revelation that an angel of the Lord appeared into him and took him on a journey to a burial ground. When they got there, the angel went straight to a tomb and tapped it.  A corpse of many years that died even before the man was born came forth and the angel told the corpse to hand over what belongs to the man to him, the corpse said he transferred it to another person before he died so the angel took him from one corpse to another like 17 people that died even before he was born. The last person they transferred it to whom the man recognized as his father’s brother who died 10years ago. The angel then asked the corpse to hand over what belongs to the man to him; the corpse went back to his tomb and brought out a calabash that contained a man, woman and 3 children. Immediately the man opened the calabash he woke up. Immediately the man woke up he noticed his manhood came alive. For the very first time in his entire life, he had sexual urge. Two months after the dream, the man gets married and within four years he has 3 children. You too can call unto God and he will surely answer you in Jesus name.</i></p>
