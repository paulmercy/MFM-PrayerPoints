My beloved friend, I want you to have a deep understanding of this message.  This will put more aggression in your prayers. Also, it will help you to know what is spiritually happening in your life from your parents or from the Holy Spirit. God can reveal anything you want to know from Him when you make the right enquiries.

<b>INHERITED FOUNDATIONAL BATTLE</b>
<ol>
<li>The foundation of our lives is very important. It is our source; our beginning, and the vehicle that brought us to this world. Our foundation is a deep mystery.</li><br>
<li>There are different battles in people’s foundation. In some families, it is sickness, untimely death, marital turbulence, and hardship in all areas. In some other families they usually start well in life and end badly, death during childbirth, stillbirth, delay in childbirth, miscarriages, etc.</li><br>
<li>This makes me remember the story of a lady. The first time I met her she was crying profusely.  I asked her why she was crying and she said she was 6 weeks pregnant and the pregnancy was the problem of her life. I asked her if she was married and she said she was happily married and she had a four months old baby she was nursing. She wanted to terminate the pregnancy and terminate her life but her husband disagreed with her.  I told her she did not have to terminate her pregnancy or her life, that I had seen people conceived 41 days after delivery of their babies. She further told me that after the delivery of her first child she was told that she went insane.  She was shown the video of how she was naked and was trying to injure herself and the baby. After she recovered from the sickness and got back home, the first sexual intercourse with her husband resulted into another pregnancy.</li><br>
<li>I told her the Lord will give her victory and she needed to go to her parents and make enquiry about what happened. She replied that her parents were late and she was their only child. I told her to look for someone in her family she could make inquiries from concerning her plight.</li><br>
<li>The next time she came back to me, she came crying.  She explained that when she got to her family compound in her village, she met an old woman and introduced herself. She explained what brought her to the village. The old woman told her that what happened to her was not a new thing that it had been in their family for many years. The old woman explained to her that her great-grand mother had the problem when she delivered her grand mom.  Her grand mom committed suicide when she couldn’t bear the shame of the insanity after delivering her mum.  Also her own mother was knocked down by a car when her insanity started as she ran out of the house. The old woman further explained to her that insanity is a family problem after delivery in their family.</li><br>
<li>I told her to have faith in God, by coming for prayers and going for deliverance until she was healed. To the glory of God, when she came back after delivering the baby, she said the doctors at the hospital had prepared to chain her down due to her first experience.  But to the glory of God, she delivered safely and no episode of madness.</li><br>
<li>You too can cry unto God and he will reveal the secret of your inherited foundational battle to you and also give you victory in Jesus name.</li>
