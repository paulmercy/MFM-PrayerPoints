<b><i>SCRIPTURE READING: Psalm 127:13-5; Isa. 8:18</i></b>
<h4>PRAISE AND WORSHIP</h4>
<p><b>CONFESSION:</b>
I am a child of the Most High God. I am express image of Jehovah God on earth. I believe in God as the creator of the heaven and the earth.
I believe in the almightiness, the most highness, and the most Excellency of Jehovah God. I believe and confess the power of his word, because by his word; the world was made and shall also be rounded up the same. I believe his word was written for me to profit withal. Therefore, I ask and receive that the power in the word of God become operational in my life as I speak it now in the name of Jesus.<br>
<br>It is written, no man can receive any good thing except it be given him from above. Therefore, I bless the name of Lord for giving me this pregnancy. It is also said in the Holy Scriptures that because what so ever.
God does is perfect and permanent, nobody can add to it or remove from it. Now I confess with my mouth that my pregnancy is a good and perfect gift from God, no power in the heavenlies or in the earth or in the seas shall be able to add any evil thing to it neither shall they be able to remove any good thing from it.<br> The Lord has established me in his righteousness, I shall be far from oppression and I shall be afraid of nothing - terror is removed far from me, it will not come near me. If anyone attacks me, it is not the Lord’s doing, whoever attacks me will surrender to me and fall for my sake. No weapon forged against me, my pregnancy, my home and anything that concerns me shall prosper.<br>
<br>The Lord is round about me now and forever just as mountains surround Jerusalem. His Holy angels also are round about me to keep me in all my ways. So that no arrow that flies by noonday or in the night shall hit at me. So that no destruction shall locate my house, so that no pestilence shall waste any of my things, so that no plague shall befall me.
<br>The Lord is my sun and my shield, he has given me his grace and glory, no good thing will he withhold from me. He also has become my song of deliverance, he has become the light of my salvation therefore my heart shall never melt because he is my rock of ages, he is with me as a mighty terrible one, he will make all my persecutors to stumble and fall, he will cause them not to prevail, for they shall not prosper, their everlasting confusion shall not be forgotten.<br>
<br>My soul will always magnify the Lord, because he has extended his faithfulness unto me. The daughter of your handmaid. I bless you because you have caused my body to be fruitful and you have also blessed the fruits of my body. I bless you because you have made me to have a testimony. My life is filled with joy unspeakable. Blessed 'be the name of the Lord.</p>
